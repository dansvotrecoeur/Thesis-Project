**Documentation of Thesis Project - Chatbot with Knowledge Graph and Named Entity Recognition for Mathematical Domain**


***1. Introduction***
This document serves as the initial documentation for the thesis project, which focuses on developing a chatbot that utilizes a knowledge graph as its database and incorporates Named Entity Recognition (NER) for vocabulary recognition within the mathematical domain.

***2. Project Overview***
The primary goal of this project is to create an intelligent chatbot capable of understanding and responding to queries related to mathematical concepts. By leveraging a knowledge graph, the chatbot can retrieve structured information, while the NER model enhances its ability to recognize and process mathematical terms accurately.

***3. Objectives***

Develop a chatbot that effectively interacts with users in the mathematical domain.

Implement a knowledge graph to store and retrieve structured mathematical information.

Integrate Named Entity Recognition (NER) to improve vocabulary identification and comprehension.

Evaluate the chatbot’s performance in understanding and responding to mathematical queries.

***4. Methodology***

Knowledge Graph Construction: The knowledge graph will be developed by collecting and structuring mathematical concepts, definitions, formulas, and relationships between entities.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): A machine learning model will be trained to identify key mathematical terms, symbols, and expressions in user queries.

Chatbot Development: The chatbot will be built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, integrating the knowledge graph and NER components for enhanced interaction.

Testing and Evaluation: The system will be tested using sample mathematical questions, and its accuracy, response time, and user satisfaction will be assessed.

***5. Expected Outcomes***

A functional chatbot capable of responding to mathematical queries with high accuracy.

An efficiently structured knowledge graph for mathematical concepts.

A trained NER model capable of recognizing mathematical vocabulary.

Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrating the chatbot’s effectiveness.

***6. Tools and Technologie***

Programming Language: Python

Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch (for NER), Dialogflow/Rasa (for chatbot development)

Database: Neo4j (for knowledge graph storage)

Libraries: spaCy, NLTK, NetworkX

***7. Conclusion***
This project aims to advance the capabilities of AI-driven chatbots in the educational sector by integrating a structured knowledge graph and an effective NER model. The findings from this research will contribute to the development of intelligent tutoring systems for mathematics.
