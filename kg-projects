Knowledge Graph (KG) Projects Documentation

1. Introduction

This document provides an overview of the Knowledge Graph (KG) projects developed as part of the research for the undergraduate thesis. The purpose of these projects is to structure and represent knowledge in a meaningful way, facilitating data retrieval, analysis, and inference.

2. Objectives

The primary objectives of the KG projects include:

Structuring unstructured data into a well-defined knowledge representation.

Enabling semantic relationships between entities.

Improving data accessibility and usability for research purposes.

Supporting inference and decision-making based on graph data.

3. Methodology

The development of the KG projects follows these steps:

Data Collection: Gathering relevant datasets from various sources.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalizing, and transforming data into a structured format.

Entity Extraction and Relationship Mapping: Identifying key entities and their relationships.

Graph Construction: Using tools and frameworks to build the knowledge graph.

Validation and Evaluation: Ensuring data consistency, correctness, and usability.

Implementation and Testing: Deploying the knowledge graph and testing its effectiveness.

4. Tools and Technologies

The following tools and technologies are used for building and managing the KG projects:

Graph Database: Neo4j

Programming Languages: Python

Data Processing Tools: Pandas, NLTK, TensorFlow (if applicable)

Visualization: Neo4j

5. Expected Outcomes

The expected outcomes of the KG projects include:

A structured and interactive knowledge representation.

Enhanced information retrieval capabilities.

Better insights derived from the interconnected data.

Potential applications in real-world scenarios relevant to the research domain.

6. Future Work

Future improvements and extensions may include:

Expanding the knowledge graph with additional datasets.

Integrating machine learning techniques for enhanced inference.

Developing user-friendly interfaces for better interaction with the KG.

7. Conclusion

The KG projects contribute significantly to structuring and representing knowledge efficiently. This documentation serves as a foundation for further development and research within the scope of the undergraduate thesis.
